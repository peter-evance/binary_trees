# Binary Trees Repository

This repository contains an implementation of binary trees written in C. Binary trees are a fundamental data structure used in computer science and can be used to efficiently store and manipulate hierarchical data.

## Overview

The binary trees repository provides a set of functions and data structures to work with binary trees. The implementation includes basic operations such as creating a binary tree, inserting nodes, deleting nodes, searching for a value, and traversing the tree in various ways.

The code is written in C, a widely used programming language known for its efficiency and low-level control. The repository is intended to serve as a reference or starting point for anyone interested in understanding or using binary trees in their projects.

## Features

- Creation of a binary tree
- Insertion of nodes
- Deletion of nodes
- Searching for a value
- Tree traversal (pre-order, in-order, post-order)
- Tree height calculation
- Node counting
- Memory management (deallocating the tree)

## Getting Started

To get started with the binary trees repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/binary-trees.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the repository directory:
   ```
   cd binary-trees
   ```

3. Compile the C source code using a C compiler:
   ```
   gcc binary_trees.c -o binary_trees
   ```

4. Run the compiled binary:
   ```
   ./binary_trees
   ```

## Usage

The binary trees implementation provides a simple command-line interface to interact with the various operations. Once you run the compiled binary, you can follow the on-screen instructions to perform operations such as creating a binary tree, inserting nodes, deleting nodes, searching for a value, and traversing the tree.

You can also integrate the binary trees code into your own C projects by including the `binary_trees.h` header file and linking against the compiled `binary_trees.c` source file. Refer to the function documentation in the source code for details on the available functions and their usage.
